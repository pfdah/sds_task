### OCR Approach for the Given Task

P.S. Please note the task I did is modified version of Pytorch Text Classification tutorial from the documentation

Create a virtual environment, for isolating the project dependencies
```bash
python -m venv task_venv
```

Install the requirements for the OCR approach from `requirements.txt` using the command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 


After successfull installation of the dependencies goto the `workflow.ipynb` and run all cells. Please make sure the __dataset__ folder is inside the _"ML"_ folder and not inside _"ocr_approach"_ or _"cv_approach"_
