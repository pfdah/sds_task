### ML Task

For the ML task, the instruction was:
```text
Build a machine learning model using the provided dataset. There are no constraints on the type
of model you build. You can choose to ignore the OCR text and build a classifier using only
image features, you can ignore the images and build a text classifier using only the OCR text, or
you can use all the available data to build the model. You can use any language or framework
you want to build the model. You will need to submit the source code you use to train and
evaluate the model. Please heavily comment the code you submit to demonstrate your
understanding. Please also include a long form description of the process you took to complete
the exam. In doing so, try to answer the following questions:
• How did you solve the problem?
• Why did you choose to solve the problem the way you did?
• What challenges did you face?
• If you had more time, what would you do differently?

```

For the task, I took references from the [PyTorch Documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html).

The Model used in OCR Approach is the slight modification of the model in the [PyTorch Text Classification Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html)
