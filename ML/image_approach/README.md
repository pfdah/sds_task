### Images Approach for the Given Task


_ __This is the second approach I completed.__ _

Create a virtual environment, for isolating the project dependencies
```bash
python -m venv task_venv
```

Install the requirements for the OCR approach from `requirements.txt` using the command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 


After successfull installation of the dependencies goto the `image_workflow.ipynb` and run all cells. Please make sure the __dataset__ folder is inside the _"ML"_ folder and not inside _"ocr_approach"_ or _"cv_approach"_

The model can be found at: [Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1D1L6J7enT6nekryKDKQAJco2i2zyXxDR)


P.S. I used the AlexNet model, one of the most popular model.
