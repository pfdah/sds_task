### Java Task
For the Java task, the instruction was:
```text
We provide you with two CSV files and you need to match lines in the first CSV to lines in the
second CSV based on the value of the first column of each file. If the first column from CSV1
matches the first column from CSV2 then the line from CSV2 should be concatenated to the line
from CSV1, but the first column from CSV2’s line should be excluded since it is already present
in CSV1’s line. The concatenated lines should then be written to an output file. We provide a
basic java class with a main method that calls combineFiles( csv1, csv2, outputFile), you must
complete the implementation of the combineFiles method.

```

For the task, I completed the task with the following _reference tutorial_ : [File operation in Java](https://www.javatpoint.com/file-operations-in-java)

After understanding the file operations, I applied the logic to perform the desired operation and dumped the output in required file.
